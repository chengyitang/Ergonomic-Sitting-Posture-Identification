# Ergonomic Sitting Posture Identification (Course: Convolutional Neural Networks and Visual Recognition)

• Gleaned training data by taking 450+ photos of seated postures using OpenCV and transformed the frames into highlighted body structures with the Pose Landmark function of MediaPipe in real time

• Trained three sitting posture detection models (AlexNet, VGGNet16, ResNet50) using TensorFlow and Keras library in Python

• Applied the model with the best performance (VGGNet16) to a real-time posture warning system, achieving a high recognition rate of 97.8%
